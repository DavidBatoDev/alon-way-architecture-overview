## Context Diagram Overview

The C4 Context diagram provides the highest level view of the Alon Documentation Site, showing how it fits into the broader organizational and technical ecosystem. This diagram illustrates the system's external interfaces, key stakeholders, and the boundary between our system and external dependencies.

## External Actors

### Human Users

- **Documentation Readers**: End users consuming technical documentation, guides, and knowledge base articles
- **Content Contributors**: Technical writers, developers, and subject matter experts creating and maintaining content
- **System Administrators**: DevOps engineers and platform administrators managing the infrastructure and deployment processes

### External Systems

- **GitHub Platform**: Provides source control, collaboration features, and CI/CD orchestration
- **Azure Cloud Platform**: Delivers hosting infrastructure, monitoring services, and security capabilities
- **Development Tools**: Local development environments, editors, and content creation tools
